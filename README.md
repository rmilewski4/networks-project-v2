# Networks Project V1

To run the project, ensure that you have python 3.3 or newer installed. All libraries used are default python libraries.

After python is installed, run the server first by **first navigating to the server directory, then** using

```python3 project_server_ryanmilewski.py```

Then you can run the client in a new terminal after the server is active by **first navigating to the client directory, then** using

```python3 project_client_ryanmilewski.py```

Note you MUST be in the given folder to run these files. This is to ensure that the server will detect the users.txt file. DO NOT run these files through IDLE or another GUI interpreter. Use the terminal to navigate to the given directory and execute the file using the python3 command inside the given directory.
